In 1788, James Watt faced a problem that would echo through every control system since: his steam engine's speed depended on load, and the only feedback mechanism—a human operator watching a gauge—couldn't react fast enough. His solution was the centrifugal governor, two weighted balls on spinning arms that would rise with speed and throttle the steam valve. The faster the engine ran, the more the governor resisted. No human in the loop, just physics regulating physics.

We're grappling with the same question two centuries later: how should an AI system regulate its own behavior? The prompt-counting hook is Watt's human operator—external, explicit, counting rotations. The AI judgment mode is the centrifugal governor—the system sensing its own momentum and deciding when reflection is needed. Neither is obviously superior. The hook provides predictability and observability; the judgment mode provides adaptability and reduces friction. What we're really designing is a meta-stable system: one that produces artifacts at a rate that feels natural to the user while remaining responsive to the actual character of the work being done.
